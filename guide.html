                            This
                            guide is designed to help you learn the very basics of League of Legends,
                            so maybe, in a couple years time, you can contribute to the builds found on our home page,
                            but
                            for the time being id recommened following
                            all the steps you will find here. If you do want to make the game more interesting, follow
                            some
                            of the builds that our community has created,
                            i will advise however, some builds are not guaranteed wins and could upset a couple
                            teammates.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To begin you will need to understand the lanes and roles within the game, we will go into
                            more
                            detail for each role however,
                            this is a quick overview. Firstly, we have the
                            top lane. Often regarded
                            as the most boring lane as the least amount of action is likely to take place. This is a
                            very
                            beginner friendly lane, you will
                            have little responsibilities so you can practice alot of the basics such as farming. Next we
                            have the jungle, my
                            personal favourite, the
                            jungle is a very hard role, you are expected to be everywhere on the map at the same time,
                            ganking, which is when you attack a lane with your teammates to try to secure a kill, as
                            well as taking all objectives, all
                            whilst keeping up with your own farming. This is probably not the best beginner role for an
                            enjoyable experience however,
                            how are you going to get good at a role if you never play it? The mid lane, everyone wants
                            to be
                            a mid laner, it can be the highest
                            reward lane if played correctly, you have a lot of responsibilities as a mid laner and are
                            the
                            most vulnerable during the game. The bottom lane
                            consits of both the ADC and support. You will most likely find that both the teammates want
                            to
                            blame each other and never take responsibility.
                            The adc is the damage on the lane, they will farm and the supports job is to protect them
                            the
                            best they can. Some supports will also look for
                            opportunites to make a play on the lane and try to get a kill for the adc.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Now we have covered a little about each lane/role, we will cover farming in the game,
                            commonly
                            known as 'csing'. As a laner, you will spend the majority of your time farming the minions
                            that
                            spawn and arrive on your lane. These minions will be your biggest source of exp and gold for
                            the
                            majority of the game so it is important you understand how to farm them correctly. As a new
                            player, you will want to last hit the minions as much as possible. Last hitting is where you
                            only ever attack the minions to make sure they die, you are not constantly auto attacking
                            the
                            minions. Constantly auto attacking the minions will lead to you pushing the lane into the
                            enemy
                            tower, where you are more vulnerable to ganks. If you are playing a melee into melee
                            match-up,
                            you will also be thinking about trading with the enemy when they are wanting to last hit a
                            minion, this is the best time to try and auto attack them a couple of times as they cannot
                            attack back until they have killed the minion. This is a rather difficult skill however it
                            will
                            come with time as you begin to recognise the enemys auto attack animation. If you are
                            playing a
                            ranged into melee matchup where you are the ranged, you will be wanting to pressure the
                            enemy
                            laner as much as possible, auto attacking them many times when they want to farm, just
                            rememeber
                            that you also should be farming the minions. You should also want to keep your distance from
                            them, if you notice them walking towards you, it would be best to run away. If you are the
                            melee
                            into a ranged vs melee matchup, you will want to just grab as much minion gold as possible
                            and
                            wait for help from your teammates, it will be a hard matchup but you wont lose so long as
                            you
                            stay in exp range. If you are in a ranged vs ranged matchup, focus all your attention on the
                            farm, chances are you wont be fighting much so you need to out farm your opponent to win the
                            lane. We will cover farming as a jungler in our jungle section.

                        <br>
                        Please read through all sections we will post here, it is very important that you understand the
                        role you will be playing, but also understand the roles your teammates will be playing. You will
                        better undertsand the game this way and hopefully win more games.

                            The top lane, we described this lane as being the most boring lane, this is only because it
                            should see the least amount of action within the first 15-20 minutes of the game. However,
                            with
                            some of the strongest champions within the game, you can have lots of fun rolling over the
                            enemy
                            if you have a good laning phase.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <b>Firstly</b> we will go over the responsibilities of the top laner. During the laning
                            phase,
                            as a top
                            laner, you will need to be securing vision within the river and close to rift herald. This
                            will
                            protect you from ganks, as well as give valuable information to the team on the location of
                            the
                            enemy jungler. Also as a top laner you will be taking teleport most of the time, you can
                            use this teleport to gank the bottom lane if the situation is there, for example if your bot
                            lane has placed a ward deep into their lane and they are being pushed into tower, you might
                            find
                            the opportunity to teleport behind the enemy bot lane and assist your bot lane in killing
                            the
                            enemy team. This is a great use of teleport as it get multiple lanes ahead, just make sure
                            you
                            hurry back to your own lane to avoid losing too much exp or gold from minions. These are the
                            responsibilities of a top laner during the laning phase of the game, beyond the laning
                            phase,
                            you will be playing as a team so all lanes and roles will be fighting together to take
                            objectives as a team.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <b>Secondly</b>, we will cover the general game play. You should always be actively
                            searching to
                            fulfill the responsibilities of a top laner, however in the time where nothing can be
                            achieved
                            you will be wanting to farm as many of the minions as possible, whilst taking good trades
                            with
                            your opponenet. The better you farm than the enemy top laner, the quicker you will reach
                            level
                            six, which is a massive power spike for most champions, as well you will be able to buy more
                            items earlier to give yourself power over your opponenet. If your enemy laner has left to
                            back
                            or assist another lane, be sure to quickly push your lane into the enemy tower, your enemy
                            cannot gain any exp or gold from minions that die to the turret. For a portion of the game,
                            the
                            towers will have plating that can give you some gold, these can be great to get so long as
                            you
                            dont greed for them and die for it to either a gank or the enemy laner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the top lane, we recommend you play: Garen, Darius, Tahm Kench or Sett. These champions
                            are
                            very strong at both fighting and taking hits, they are very easy to farm with and synergise
                            well
                            with the team. Here is an example of the core items for each of thses champions. These are
                            complete items, dont forget boots!
                        </p>

                        <h1>Jungle</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The jungle is the most difficult role to play, however it can be the most enjoybale. Often,
                            games will end with the salty teammates saying 'diff jung' because one of the junglers did
                            amazingly in comparison to the other. When an inexperienced jungler plays the role vs an
                            experienced player, the difference can be shocking. If you intend on playing this role, it
                            is very important you both understand the role and the matchup, we will cover the basics
                            about the role, be sure to check out the community builds to find more information about
                            matchups.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Again to begin with we will cover the responsibilities of the jungler, you are not playing
                            on a lane as a jungler, you have six camps, each with varying difficulty, exp and gold gains
                            to each other. You need to be sure you are clearing your camps as soon as they appear or as
                            soon as possible. You will also have to clear the rift scuttle found in the river, which
                            spawns at a slower rate than your camps. This can give massive exp and gold as well as
                            vision for the teammates and should be priotised where possible. There is also the dragon
                            and rift herald found in the river. These two massive monsters may require multiple
                            teammates to clear if you are not strong enough alone. The dragon will grant permanant buffs
                            to your team depening on the element. The rift herald will grant the holder of the eye of
                            rift herald, an advanced recall as well as the ability to place a rift herald down on a lane
                            that will help clear towers. This gives a great advantage to your team and should be a
                            focus, bare in mind however that the eye is a one time use and does expire.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Ganking is also the job of a jungler, ganking is where you approach a lane to help your
                            teammates kill the enemy or push towers, this should only be done at specific times however
                            otherwise your teammates could be annoyed by you. You will learn to spot opportunites for
                            ganks as you continue to play the role.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Counter jungling is another key component of jungling. Given that you and the enemy jungler
                            only have six camps to clear, it can be very advantagous to take one of the enemy junglers
                            camps. This could massively put the enemy jungler behind, just make sure however you are in
                            a situation where that may be possible such as your laners have priority in their lane.
                            Being killed in this situation will set you back massively so approach with causion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the jungle, we recommend you play: Trundle, Warwick, Volibear or Hecarim.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Mid Lane</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The mid lane, everybody wants to be a mid laner. It is the most 'flashy' role of them all
                            with the ability to make big plays due to the hyper carry champs that are mid laners.
                            However this happens very little and is not a common occurence. The mid lane is the shortest
                            lane as well as has the most open sides, meaning the opportunites to get ganked are very
                            high if you push to far up. It is recommended in this role to try and stay under tower where
                            possible, you will be safest in this position. With there being the most open sides, this
                            means you are surrounded by the most fog of war, so warding the bushes and river surrounding
                            your lane can give you safety needed to push into the lane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a mid laner, you will have the most opportunites to roam and assist your teammates. You
                            are the center of the map so you can travel to either top lane or the bottom lane to assist
                            them, you are most likely in the best position to help the jungler if he needs help fighting
                            in the river or jungle. This is a big responsibility of the mid laner which many players can
                            find frustrating. Your teammates will also be annoyed if you dont try to fulfill these
                            responsibilities so its best to try.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the mid lane, we recommend you play: Annie, Lissandra, Veigar or Lux.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is a popular saying with the game that 'support wins the lane, adc wins the game',
                            this is for the most part a true statement and that playing adc is very difficult in the
                            early stages of the game, you will be very squishy and not deal aloy of damage. However as
                            the game progresses, you will build more items and become stronger, eventually it is
                            expected that you will deal the most damage during fights as your teammates protect both you
                            and the mid lane.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As an adc, your main focus should be on farming and dodging any advances the enemy team
                            tries to make on killing you. Getting any kills can dramatically increase your power and
                            help you end a game earlier. Your main focus should be on survival until you can protect
                            yourself, however you will always be succeptible to assassins so because if they are not on
                            the map.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the adc role, we recommend you play: Ezreal, Lucian, Tristana or Kai'Sa.

                            You will need to ward for security reasons around the bot lane, within bushes and the river.
                            This will protect you and your adc from ganks. If the time comes it is better for you to die
                            instead of the adc, so make the ultimate sacrifice. You should also be roaming to try and
                            assist other lanes or the jungler. You will act as a secondary jungler in respect to roaming
                            to mid lane to try and secure a kill. You should only do this however if the situation
                            allows for it and the adc is in a comfortable position.
